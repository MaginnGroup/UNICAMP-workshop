These are the two directories containing materials for the MD portion of the workshop.

We will start with LJ-Examples, where we will cover the basics of LAMMPS use
on simple, short simulations of the Lennard-Jones fluid.

The ethanol directory contains scripts and example input files for conducting
an NPT equilibration of an OPLS-AA model of ethanol at 298K and 1 atm. Once the
density is determines, an NVT simulation is run at that density. The output of
this is used by PyLAT to compute the self-diffusivity and radial distribution
function.

Setup of the ethanol system (creation of the LAMMPS data file) is made possible
by MoSDeF tools mbuild and foyer.
